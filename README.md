This project implements the classic "Simon Says" memory game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game challenges the player to remember and repeat a sequence of colors.

- **User Input**: The player must reproduce the sequence by clicking on the tiles in the correct order.
- **Levels**: The game progresses through levels, with each level increasing the length of the color sequence.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the player clicks the wrong tile or fails to reproduce the sequence correctly.
- **Scoring**: The game displays the level reached before game over.
- **Start/Restart**: A button allows the player to start a new game or restart the game after game over.
- **Visual Feedback**: Tiles light up when they are part of the sequence or when the user clicks them.
- **User Messages**: The game displays messages to inform the player about their turn and the current level.
